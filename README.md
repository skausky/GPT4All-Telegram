# Telegram AI Chat Bot using GPT-4All and Python: A Step-by-Step Guide

`python -m venv teleGptVenv`

`.\teleGptVenv\Scripts\activate`

`pip install gpt4all python-telegram-bot`

Once you have created the virtual environment and installed the dependencies, create a file with your preferred name with the file extension ofÂ .py and open it in your IDE.
